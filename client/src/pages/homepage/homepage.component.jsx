          Weâ€™ve been dancing in our respective communities for over 7 years and
          have always appreciated the power of dance. Dancing energizes. It
          uplifts. It also has this incredible ability to bring people together
          - from all walks of life, all ages, all backgrounds. Having seen and
          experienced firsthand some of the challenges that come along with
          dancing in a social setting, we were driven to help solve these
          problems to ensure that every dancer has a positive experience on the
          dance floor.
