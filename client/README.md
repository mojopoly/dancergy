<h1><a href="https://dancergy.herokuapp.com/">Dancergy E-Commerce App</a></h1>

<h1>Front End Code

<h1>Tech Stack</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Front-End:HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (bootstrapped with Create-React-App)</li>
  <li>Server: Node.js, Express.js</li>
  <li>Firebase</li>
  <li>Stripe Checkout Integration</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Guidelines</h2><br>
<p>The aim for this project is to build an ecommerce app to sell a handful of dancing accessories. To complete the project, the below user stories needed to be fulfilled:</p><br>
<ul>
<li>I can go to collection page/individual product pages from home page </li>
<li>I am able to register both with email and Gmail </li>
<li>I am able to login and logout </li>
<li>I am able to checkout and pay with a credit card </li>
<li>I am able to see my cart items even if I leave the website and come back to it. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Approach</h2>
<p>For this full-stack web app, I created the front end components and UI using React, JavaScript, CSS & HTML. This involved creating the signin, register and the home (logged in) screens along with Google OAuth.</p><br>

<p>The next part was creating the backend of this project using node.js and express to get a token from front end and process payment using Stripe gateway.</p><br>


<p>The app was fully deployed to Heroku.</p><br>
